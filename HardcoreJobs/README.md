We need to implement jobs for:

* Lumberjack - Can cut trees, plant saplings
* Builder    - Can build in the Wild
* Miner      - Can mine in the Wild
* Slayer     - Can kill mobs easier than normal players
* Trader     - Gets a % Bonus on all sales
* Farmer     - Can get Crow crops, Breed animals, and Craft Food.
* Mage       - Can make potions, enchant stuff
* Crafter    - Can craft items (other than food) for others

Jobs should be able to specialise:
* When a job reaches a certain level, e.g. 50, a cap is hit
* Hitting this cap unlocks specialised jobs that are more lucrative in specific areas

E.g.
At Lv50 miner (Or whatever level, TBD), you reach the maximum level for mining.
This may allow you to specialise in, say:
* Mining a specific ore
  * Gold
  * Diamond
  * You get the gist
* Mining decorative stones, e.g. cobblestone, andesite, diorite, granite (all combined)
  * Excavating large areas of land made mostly of pure grass/dirt/stone
  
These specialisations come with all the perks of a Lv50 miner plus more
* If you switch between mining specilisations, you reset to Miner 50
* If you switch out so that you are not doing a mining job at all, your mining level will reset entirely (or drop to a fairer level still below 50; TBD)
