We need to implement jobs for:

Lumberjack - Can cut trees, plant saplings
Builder    - Can build in the Wild
Miner      - Can mine in the Wild
Slayer     - Can kill mobs easier than normal players
Trader     - Gets a % Bonus on all sales
Farmer     - Can get Crow crops, Breed animals, and Craft Food.
Mage       - Can make potions, enchant stuff
Crafter    - Can craft items (other than food) for others


Ideally I'd like jobs to later branch out
So more profit at the cost of further specialisation
So a small town can get away with fewer jobs
That are more broad
But less refined
E.g. even miner splits into different ores at super high tiers
